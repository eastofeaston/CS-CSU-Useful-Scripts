# GlobalProtect VPN

Built for Mac.

## globalprotect.sh

This is syntactic sugar for systemctl. However, I prefer being able to toggle 
the VPN without having to go dig for that command. Essentially, there are two 
options.

Apparently, at an admin level, CSU can control wether an easily accessible 
enable/disable toggle is available. I like my machines under my control. I 
still don't fully trust that GlobalProtect won't phone home, but I much prefer 
to have my own computers to be under my control. It's a step in the right 
direction at least.

You'll want to rerun using the start option before launching GlobalProtect 
again as it's liable to have errors without it.
